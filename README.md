Developed a machine learning model using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
Implemented the model to analyze patient data and provide predictions without the need for direct doctor involvement.
Enhanced the model's accuracy through data preprocessing and feature selection, ensuring reliable predictions.
